# monster-battles
## Create battles between randomly generated monsters

### Two monsters are created with random attributes, and are made to fight each other... ***to the death***

#### v1.2.0 adds possibility to have multiple fights!
- Force the winner of the last fight back into the arena with a new monster
- Go until you just can't anymore!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A monster's attributes are:**
- Name
- Type (Race)
- Health
- Weapon
  - Name
  - Damage
  - Attack speed
  - DPS
- Defense**

** The monster's *effective* defense `= defense * a reduction constant` to keep things balanced
